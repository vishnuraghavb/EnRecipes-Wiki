# Privacy Policy

I (Vishnu Raghav B) built the app EnRecipes as an open source app for use as is.

## Your Privacy

As a privacy-conscious internet user, I respect your privacy; that's why this app has NO Ads, NO User Tracking and does NOT collect or share any personal information.

The app also does NOT use third-party services that collect information used to identify you.

## Links To Third Party Websites

The app may contain links to other sites. If you click on a third-party link, you will be directed to that site. Please be aware that I am not responsible for the privacy policies on these websites. These sites are not subject to this privacy policy, and you should check their individual privacy policies.

## Changes To This Privacy Policy

I will occasionally update this Privacy Policy but only in a manner not affecting your privacy. Thus, you are advised to review this page periodically. I will notify you of any changes by posting the new privacy policy on this page. I will also change the "Last Updated" date at the end of this privacy policy. Any changes I make to the privacy policy are effective as of this Last Updated date and replace any prior privacy policies.

If I make any material changes to this privacy policy, I will notify you by placing a prominent notice on my app.

## Contact Information

For any questions, suggestions or concerns regarding my privacy policy, please send me an email to apps@vishnuraghav.com.
